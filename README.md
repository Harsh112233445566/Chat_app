## About

The MERN Chat App is a real-time messaging platform where users can sign up, log in, and communicate in private chats. The app uses **MongoDB** as the database to store user data and messages, **Express.js** and **Node.js** to handle the backend server, and **React** to create a responsive frontend interface. **Socket.IO** is used for real-time communication between users.

### Key Features:
- Real-time messaging between users
- User authentication (sign up, login)
- Dockerized for containerized deployment
- MongoDB as the NoSQL database
- Profile picture/avatar support

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up and log in.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Chat with other users in real-time using WebSockets.
- **Socket.IO Integration**: Seamless two-way communication between the client and server for instant message delivery.
- **Avatar Setup**: Users can set up a profile picture after signing up.
- **Docker Support**: Both backend and frontend are Dockerized for simple and scalable deployment.

```bash
https://github.com/Harsh112233445566/Chat_app.git
```

### Install Dependencies

You can use either **npm** or **yarn** to install the required packages.

#### Using npm:
For backend (Node.js/Express):

```bash
cd public/chatapp
npm install
```

For frontend (React):

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Using Yarn:
For backend:

```bash
cd public/chatapp
yarn install
```

For frontend:

cd server
yarn install
```

### MongoDB Setup

Make sure you have MongoDB installed locally or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to set up a cloud database.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directories of both backend and frontend to store environment variables.

### Backend `.env`:

```bash
PORT = 3002
MONGO_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/school"
```

---

## Docker Setup

### Build and Run the Application with Docker:

The application is Dockerized for easy deployment. To run the backend, frontend, and MongoDB in containers:

1. **Build and start the containers**:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:

- Backend on `http://localhost:3002`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- MongoDB instance

2. **Stop the containers**:

To stop the running containers, press `Ctrl+C` or run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
